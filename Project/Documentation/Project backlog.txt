-manually associate a classification with an object
-take all features of an object and determine which are most important to identify it
	-which features do not matter?
	-which features are essential?
-associate an object with a set of features
-import a picture of an object on a plain background from phone to picture library and give it a classification
-select an image on phone to be classified
-reject the application's classification
	-enter custom classification
	-cancel classification
-view images and associated classifications in picture library
	-images grouped by classification and alphabetized
-modify pictures in library
	-change classification
	-remove picture and classification
-classifications generated by application look different than manually assigned classifications
	-manual classifications in black
	-generated classifications in green
